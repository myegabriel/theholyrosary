          <p class="praytherosary"> <em>Praying the Rosary</em> is not just simply about reciting prayers.
            It involves reflecting on the grace of God.
            Praying is a powerful act that lets us develop and <em>strengthen our relationship with
              God</em> and the Rosary offers the same beautiful reward. By praying the Rosary,
            we meditate on the events in the life of Jesus Christ and this <em>lets us know God more</em>.</p>

          <h3>Apostles' Creed</h3>
          <p>I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of Heaven and earth;
            and in Jesus Christ, His only Son Our Lord,
            Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.
            He descended into Hell; the third day He rose again from the dead;
            He ascended into Heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of God, the Father almighty; from thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead.
            I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body and life everlasting.</p>

            on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our
            daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we
            forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us
            not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.</p>

          <p>Hail, holy Queen, mother of mercy, our life, our sweetness, and our hope. To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve. To thee do we send up our sighs mourning and weeping in this valley of tears. Turn then, most gracious
            advocate,
            thine eyes of mercy toward us, and after this our exile show us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus. O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary.
            Pray for us, O Holy Mother of God.
            That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.</p>

          <p>Let us pray: O God, whose Only Begotten Son,
            by his life, Death, and Resurrection,has purchased for us the rewards of eternal life,
            grant, we beseech thee,
            that while meditating on these mysteries
            of the most holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary,
            we may imitate what they contain
            and obtain what they promise,
            through the same Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>
